# 🚨 Emergency Vehicle Traffic System  

The **Emergency Vehicle Traffic System** is an embedded C++ project designed to solve one of the biggest urban problems: **delayed emergency response due to traffic congestion**.  

When ambulances, fire trucks, or police vehicles get stuck in traffic, it can cost precious lives. This project provides an **automated traffic control solution** that detects emergency vehicles and gives them **priority passage** by dynamically controlling traffic lights.  

---

## 🧭 Project Explanation  

- The system is programmed on an **embedded microcontroller** (Arduino/ESP or similar).  
- Emergency vehicles are detected using **sensors** or **wireless modules** (e.g., RF/IR/GPS-based).  
- Once detected, the system **overrides normal traffic signals** and immediately turns the light **green** in the direction of the emergency vehicle.  
- After the vehicle passes, the signals **return to normal operation**.  

This ensures:  
✔️ Faster emergency response times  
✔️ Reduced road accidents due to chaotic traffic handling  
✔️ Smarter cities with efficient traffic management

## ✨ Key Features  

- Automatic detection of emergency vehicles  
- Real-time traffic light control  
- Written in efficient **C++** for microcontrollers  
- Supports extension to **IoT-based smart city integration**

## ⚙️ Getting Started  

### Clone the repo:  
`bash
git clone https://github.com/Rajrajput-prog/Emergency-Vehicle-Traffic-System.git
cd Emergency-Vehicle-Traffic-System

### Setup Development Environment:

Use PlatformIO, Arduino IDE, or your preferred embedded C++ toolchain.

Ensure hardware connections (sensors/LEDs for signals) are made.

### Build & Flash:

Compile the code and upload it to your microcontroller.

### Run & Test:

Simulate an emergency vehicle detection and watch traffic signals adapt automatically.
